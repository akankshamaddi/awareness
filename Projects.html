        <p> Wear Orange: On June 2nd and 3rd, thousands of Americans wore orange to send the powerful message that there is more we can do to end gun violence. But the work doesn't end there. Everytown and our partner organizations continue to do life-saving work so that we can get closer to realizing a future free of gun violence. We wore orange to be seen, now demand that we will be heard. </p>

        <p> End Gun Violence poster campaign: In the immediate aftermath of tragedies such as the shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school or at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, the issue of the escalation of gun violence in our communities typically receives intense media coverage. But this disturbing trend typically slips quickly from the attention of both the public and policy makers—until another horrific event occurs.

In early 2013, AIGA sponsored participation in a campaign for change by encouraging member designers to submit a nonpartisan public-awareness poster to the “End Gun Violence” project. Like the “Get Out the Vote” campaigns, the primary vehicle was an open, online collection of members’ designs bearing the AIGA campaign identity, where visitors can download a PDF version to print and post, or an image to share on social media.

The power of the “End Gun Violence” campaign is in the collection of voices, supporting the simple premise that gun violence is detrimental to the life of our communities. If the full strength of our profession’s creativity can be harnessed to clarify and give form to this subject, we may be able to command the attention of the public and to help effect a solution.

AIGA encourages members to seize the initiative in activating our community on issues that matter in a constructive, nonpartisan and persuasive manner. These efforts reinforce the power of the design community and the relevance of their creative talents.</p>
